**Important Note on the Password:** As requested, I have included the specified admin password. However, I have also added a strong security warning and instructions for the **recommended, secure method** using the `create_admin.php` script. This is standard practice for public repositories.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

You need a local server environment that supports PHP and MySQL. We recommend **XAMPP**:
*   [Download and Install XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

### 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone this repository into your XAMPP `htdocs` folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/debarjunmaharaj/ShopWave.git
```
*(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)*

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it into the `htdocs` folder (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\ShopWave`).

### 3. Database Setup

1.  **Start XAMPP:** Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.
2.  **Open phpMyAdmin:** Click the "Admin" button next to MySQL to open phpMyAdmin in your browser.
3.  **Create a Database:**
    *   Click **"New"** on the left sidebar.
    *   Enter the database name as `ecommerce_db`.
    *   Click **Create**.
4.  **Import the SQL File:**
    *   Select the `ecommerce_db` database you just created.
    *   Go to the **"Import"** tab.
    *   Click **"Choose File"** and select the `database.sql` file located in the root of this project.
    *   Click **Go** at the bottom of the page. This will create all the necessary tables and default settings.

### 4. Admin User Setup

You have two options to create your admin user. The first is quick for local testing, but the second is highly recommended for security.

#### Option A: Quick & Easy (For Local Testing)

The database is pre-configured with the following admin credentials as requested:

*   **Username:** `admin`
*   **Password:** `netfieadmin1234`

> üö® **SECURITY WARNING** üö®
>
> This method is **highly insecure** for a live server. The password for this user is stored in the `create_admin.php` file in plain text. **Do not use this method for production.** Please use Option B for a secure setup.

#### Option B: Secure Method (Recommended)

1.  **Edit the script:** Open the `create_admin.php` file in your code editor.
2.  **Change the password:** Find the line `$admin_password = 'netfieadmin1234';` and change the password to a new, strong password of your choice.
3.  **Run the script:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/ShopWave/create_admin.php`.
4.  **DELETE THE SCRIPT:** After you see the success message, **you must delete the `create_admin.php` file from your project folder.**

### 5. Run the Application

You are all set!

*   **Website Homepage:** [http://localhost/ShopWave/](http://localhost/ShopWave/)
*   **Admin Login Page:** [http://localhost/ShopWave/admin/login.php](http://localhost/ShopWave/admin/login.php)

## üóÇÔ∏è Admin Panel Functionality

The admin panel is the heart of your store management.

*   **Dashboard:** View key metrics like pending orders and total revenue.
*   **Products:** Add new products with images, edit existing ones, or delete them.
*   **Orders:** View all customer orders, see their details, and update the order status (e.g., from `Pending` to `Shipped`).
*   **Slider:** Upload and manage the images that appear in the homepage slider.
*   **Settings:** Update your site's currency, homepage text, and footer content without needing to edit code.
